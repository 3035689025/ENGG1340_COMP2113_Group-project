## Title of project: Officer 
_a game inspired by Papers Please_

#### Settings:
Year 2077: Earth is opening after 30 years of self-isolation\
Location: Earth Border \
Role: Border officer, B-263-54

#### Game description:
"Officer" is a story-based RPG (role-playing game) based on the game “Papers please”. Although we have borrowed concepts such as checking documents and secret missions from the original game, the gameplay and story of “Officer” is completely original.

In this game, players take up the position of a border officer to Earth, where it is opened after 30 years of isolation. By cross-referencing the documents presented by visitors and data provided by your superior, players have to approve or disapprove visitors’ entry to the recently opened Earth. As the difficulty rises (weeks elapsed), more details will need to be inspected by the players and more events (secret missions) will be prompted. The following is an example of a passport from a visitor:

Name: Arthur Holiday\
Gender: Heart\
Date of birth: 09/08/1502\
Date of issue: 11/21/2070\
Country: The Heartlands (Mars)\
Passport number: 3689 4567 8991
__________________________________________________________

##### Basic game rules:
Players will be provided with related information, such as years till expiration and planets to disprove,  to cross-reference against this passport. As more weeks have passed, there may be more than one document to check, so players will have to input “A” or “B” to access (print out) different documents. This function can also be used to access the data/documents provided by the superior.

After each week, players’ performance will be evaluated by the time spent and the accuracy of approvals. Players are incentivized to reach a high mark as our rare condition (caused by The Infected blood) requires an expensive medicine (although money will evanually run out no matter how well we perform) and food will take up a majority of our paycheck (starvation can be one of the endings).


Events and cases:\
*Normal encounters: 40% should be disapproved*


Week 1)\
Introduction to the setting and job.\
Only humans should be approved. \
(easy, introducing how to play)


Week 2)\
Only:\
Humans \
Aliens with passports from approved countries/ planets \
(A rebel,alien spy, introduces us to the existence of The Rebellion by handing us a pamphlet.)


Week 3)\
Only:\
Humans with passports from approved planets\
Aliens with passports from approved countries/ planets, with approved visas\
(The last case will be an encounter with a rebel.)

A major twist is revealed by a letter from the player’s mother. 300 years ago, Earth was origainlly occupied by the alien species, The Infected, but was since taken away by humans. As victory is often written by the victors, history books has referred to  the deportation of “The Infected species”  in 1800s as a victory of humans defending their motherland against external aliens powers. Even the name “The Infected” is to associate the species with a negative stigma to further alienate them from Earth.

In the last part of the letter, it is also revealed that the player secretly bears the bloodline of The Infected. The player will then be more incentivized to join the rebellion (secret missions) against humanity, or even feel guilty about prior disapproved entries for The Infected. 


Week 4)\
Only:\
Humans with passports from approved planets\
Aliens with passports from approved countries/ planets, with approved visas\
Name is not mentioned on ‘The Wanted” list\
(The last case will be the encounter to introduce the Earth officials visit if the player fulfills the requirements)\
After this week, our superior will announce a paycut to further put load on our financial situation.


Week 5)\
Only:\
Humans with passports from approved planets\
Aliens with passports from approved countries/ planets, with approved visas\
Name is not mentioned on ‘The Wanted” list\
(Includes the 3 cases)\
(Gameplay will not be the highlight of this day as to let the story shine.)

Players may struggle to pick a stand or wish to play out differnet scienarios/endings, so we believe our game has a compelling story and high replayablity. Our game also has different elements of programming that meets the requirements as explained as follows.



#### List of features


###### Requirement 1- Generation of random game sets or events

Random game sets:

Entrants’ information including name, passport number, gender will be created in the program and stored into arrays. \
For each entrant in the game, their information will be randomly drawn from the arrays. \
False passport information (E.g. not existing country or typo) may also be randomly drawn from the list. \
For this situation, the player may consider to  disapprove of its entry. (60% True, 40% False)



###### Requirement 2- Data structures for storing game status

Array of integers will be used to store the game status. \
The array will store:\
(1) Gameweek\
(2) Money\
(3) Number of times of disapproving human entries\
(4) Number of times of false approved alien entries\
(5) Number of times of approving earth officials to Earth



###### Requirement 3- Dynamic memory management

Dynamic array structure will be used to store the game status. As some of the game status data will only exist when the game comes to a particular gameweek.

For example,
1. Earth officials will go to earth only on game-week 5
and thus the variable - Number of times of approving earth officials to Earth, will be declared on week5.
2. The gameweek variable in the array will be declared after the player starts the game or loads the save.

Therefore, the program will request for memory if needed (when the game come to a particular gameweek or step)



###### Requirement 4- File input/output (e.g., for loading/saving game status)

For the end of each week, players can save their gamestatus in the menu.\
The save will be stored into a text format file. The format of the game save is “Description, Value” in each line.\
It is designed not to encrypt deliberately so that the players can get a particular ending of the game. \
Easter egg endings are also designed for players who modify the money data, gameweek.\
\
Format of the game save is as follow:\
\
Gameweek, 7
Money, 999999\
Number of times of disapproving human entries, 3\
Number of times of false approved alien entries, 5

###### Requirement 5- Program codes in multiple files

The program codes will be saved in multiple files based on the different functions.
Main file for programming the functions of the main function including start(), exit() when executing the game program.

1. Gameplay file for programming the main game-play and including the dialogues that provides the introduction and different special rules each week.

2. Event file for programming some special event that may happen on a particular gameweek. Those event functions will be called on particular game-weeks.

3. Ending file stores different endings of the game and the functions inside the ending files will be called when the player meets all the prerequisites of the ending.

4. Saving Load files will involve the saving and loading function of the game status.
